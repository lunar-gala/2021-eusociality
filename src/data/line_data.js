    description: 'Gossamer Idle is a combination between the grandeur of the Renaissance and modern day elegance. This idea stems from our luna moth motif — representing the renewal of body and spirit regeneration and ties in to our intent to create a new version of an old trend. With flowy and translucent material paired with harsher metals and leather, we create a sense of duality between femininity and masculinity in each look. Instead of following the distinct binary roles from old Europe, we believe that fashion is not a performance but performative, and we can use fashion to undermine gender stereotypes.',

NOMEN: the end of pigmentation. NOIR: storage and transportation of memories become achievable. NOMAD: functionalism and utilitarianism are main ideologies. NORRIN: a group of interstellar hipsters rises. NOAH: new myths and tales were created based on life on earth. NO.1379: a protest against the human race invading other civilizations. NOTO: women warriors become leaders of the human race.',

    description: 'Before 2020, we dreamed of an immersive, virtual future, of automata and instancy and the superhuman, but none of it was necessary. Today, as a result of the pandemic, we have finally gotten a taste of a virtual future — and it has notes of danger. Virtuality dictates our working, learning, socializing, and entertainment, harming our minds, bodies, and goals, and Digital Warfare is a call to revolt. We illustrate eight bright, dauntless, and forceful leaders in the movement, each representing a negative impact of technology, who seek a return and adherence to traditional reality.',

    description: 'ICARUS creates a vision of post-apocalyptic, human architectures while exploring the evolution of solar shading and environmental protection systems. As global heating consumes landmasses and sediment pollutes airways, the call to shelter in place within one’s own personal space becomes real. While alarms blare in today’s hazmat suit, the future of skin and protection allows us to filter ultraviolet and pollution while living a lifestyle of the occasion. Through exploring and recreating iconic forms that emblemize and transcend class and gender, we created a world where beauty is isolation, mechanics, and self-obsession.',

Our first alumna is Grace Kao, whose line will be androgynous and soft, pulled together by the color white, which will represent a blank slate and hopeful new beginning for 2021. Next, Terry Boyd will infuse the 90’s in his line of male streetwear, incorporating pieces from the Spice Girls, his first musical love. He will work in black and white, embroidery, and gold leaf. We are glad to have them back in the community and designing for Lunar Gala.',
